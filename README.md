## ⚡ Create Inertia Components Easily

This starter kit includes a custom Artisan command to quickly generate Inertia.js React components with flexible directory options.

### 🏗️ Generate a New Component

```bash
php artisan make:inertia Components/MyComponent
```

This will create:

```
resources/js/Components/MyComponent.jsx
```

### 📂 Flexible Folder Placement

You can specify different folders using flags:

-   `-c` or `--components`: Create the component in `resources/js/Components/`
-   `-l` or `--layouts`: Create the component in `resources/js/Layouts/`
-   `-s` or `--sections`: Create the component in `resources/js/Sections/`
-   `-p` or `--pages`: Create the component in `resources/js/Pages/`

✅ **Example usage with flags:**

```bash
php artisan make:inertia Dashboard -p
```

Creates:

```
resources/js/Pages/Dashboard.jsx
```

You can also create nested folders like:

```bash
php artisan make:inertia Components/Auth/Login
```

Creates:

```
resources/js/Components/Auth/Login.jsx
```

### ✨ Example Generated Component

```jsx
import React from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
    return <div>{/* MyComponent component */}</div>;
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### 🚀 Smart Behavior

-   Automatically prevents duplicate folder nesting.
-   Opens the newly created file in your default editor.
-   Ensures the correct folder placement, whether using flags or specifying the path.

---

This command ensures that components are placed in the correct directory and prevents overwriting existing files. It also automatically opens the newly created file for editing.

## ⚡ Create Orion Controllers Easily

This starter kit also includes a command to quickly generate Orion controllers along with their associated models:

### 🏗️ Generate a New Orion Controller

```bash
php artisan make:orion PostController
```

This will create:

-   `app/Http/Controllers/Orion/PostController.php`
-   `app/Models/Post.php` (if it doesn’t exist)
-   Adds a route in `routes/api.php`

### 📂 File Structure

```
app/Http/Controllers/Orion/PostController.php
app/Models/Post.php
```

### ✨ Example Generated Controller

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Orion;

use Orion\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Models\Post;

class PostController extends Controller
{
    protected $model = Post::class;
}
```

### 🔗 Auto-Registered Route in `routes/api.php`

```php
Orion::resource('posts', \App\Http\Controllers\Orion\PostController::class)->middleware(['auth', 'web']);
```

This command ensures that controllers are correctly placed, models are created if missing, and routes are automatically registered.
